Installing using a ZIP file (Linux/macOS)
#########################################

For Linux or macOS users (or advanced Windows users), 2 zipped GeoNetwork distributions
are available.

Both ZIP files include the following:

- GeoNetwork application

- Jetty servlet container

- Shell scripts (``.sh``, ``.bat``) to start and stop GeoNetwork


One of the ZIP files is a slight modification of the original one and includes
the European Union INSPIRE configuration.

Please download the desired ZIP file and extract it to a preferred location on your machine.
When done, open the containing folder and navigate to the ``bin`` folder. This should include
2 ``.sh`` files that can be used to start and stop GeoNetwork (use the ``.bat`` files on Windows).
Please double-click on the ``startup.sh`` file to start the server.

In the application root folder, you will find a ``readme.html`` file that includes some
details on how to get started with GeoNetwork. Double-click it to view it in your browser.
